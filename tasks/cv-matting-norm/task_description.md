# Image Matting: Normalization

## Research Question

Design the convolutional normalization operator and measure its effect under the
complete fixed training schedule. No ordering is assumed in the instruction.

## Implementation Contract

Modify `make_norm(num_ch)` in `image-matting/solution/norm.py`. It must return a
`torch.nn.Module` that maps finite feature tensors to finite tensors without
changing batch, channel, or spatial shape.

## Fixed Protocol

- Data: the complete licensed Adobe Composition-1K inventory: 43,100 training
  composites and all 1,000 test composites. Synthetic proxies and selected test
  slices do not participate.
- Training: one model for 100,000 optimizer steps, batch 8, random 320x320 crops,
  Adam at 1e-4 with cosine decay, seed 42.
- Evaluation: the trained model is evaluated on every test composite under
  deterministic alpha-derived trimap widths 6 (`medium`), 9 (`wide`), and 12
  (`xwide`). All three settings participate in scoring.
- This is an explicit full-inventory research protocol. Its three trimaps are
  derived from ground-truth alpha and are not presented as the official
  Composition-1K single-trimap leaderboard protocol.
- The scored metric is alpha SAD divided by 1000 after fixing known foreground and
  background pixels. Whole-image MSE and a deterministic finite-difference edge
  error are diagnostic only.
- Missing, crashing, wrong-shape, negative-loss, or non-finite editable output
  invalidates verification. The harness never substitutes another implementation.
